These are [metal earth models](http://www.fascinations.com/metalearth) that I have built over the years.
I feel this displays a talent and enthusiasm for modelling and tinkering. Also I have included a peice of digital artwork I did based on a blender tutorial. I am teaching myself to model in blender because I may want to pursue a career in digital art.
