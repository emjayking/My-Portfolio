I have made a number of detailed metal earth models over the years. Most of these are from [Metal Earth](http://www.fascinations.com/metalearth). I have elected to include them here as evidence of my skill in creating/crafting things. I have also included some digital modelling as well which was done in blender based on tutorials.
