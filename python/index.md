If you were to download these files and try to run them, they would not work. So just take my word for it when I say they are awesome. To run them you must install the latest [python idle](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then open the file using the IDLE application and run the code.
I do not recommend doing this, instead I will insert screen shots and describe what the code does.
You can ask the DIT teacher to run the files if you would proof that they work.

## [Automatic Spirograph](https://github.com/emjayking/My-Portfolio/blob/master/python/autospiro.py)
This awesome little code creates a random spirograph. After a certain amount of time the spirograph will change to a new one. The colour of the line is random. This code was a pet project of mine, it is a modified version of someone else's work. I copied their calculations for the drawing of the graph but I customised the code to make it automatic and random. I also improved the stability of it so it no longer randomly crashes (like the original did.)
