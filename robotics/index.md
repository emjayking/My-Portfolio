This folder contains all the robotics work I have done. This will eventually include coding examples as well as photos of the robot and videos of it in progress.
The robot is one we use for competitions in the Manawatu region, we won almost every competition we attended this year.
Obviously this is a team effort so if James Gamby-Haycock or Sean Preston apply for this class as well, please consider any vex robotics examples as a part of their application as well.


Also this will include some programming of a drone. This is all my own work.
