### [home](../index.md)


This folder contains all the robotics work I have done. This will eventually include coding examples as well as photos of the robot and videos of it in progress.
The robot is one we use for competitions in the Manawatu region, we won almost every competition we attended this year.
Obviously this is a team effort so if James Gamby-Haycock or Sean Preston apply for this class as well, please consider any vex robotics examples as a part of their application as well.


Also this will include some programming of a drone. This is all my own work.


## Drone
I have taught myself to program [Parrot Mambo] Drones using python. The video below shows a demonstration of this. I program the drone on my computer then send the code to GitHub and then connect to a raspberry pi  (a tiny computer, about the size of a credit card) via SSH (secure shell). I then execute the updated code on the raspberry pi. The drone connects to the pi using low energy bluetooth A.K.A BLE. the drone then moves through the sequence of instructions in the code. This is useful for if you want a drone to perform the same exact actions every single time however I am not yet able to control the drone live (like using a remote control.) This is what I want to do in 2019 as a part of my DIT class.

## robotics
As mentioned previously, the Vex EDR robot was constructed and programmed by Sean Preston, Jack McNelly, James Gamby-Haycock and myself. I however was the 'main mechanic.' In the video below, we are in a 'fight'
at a competition. This version of the robot is piloted by James Gamby-Haycock and was primarily built by me and Jack McNelly. It was programmed by Sean Preston.
